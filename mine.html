          <h3 id="mine">Paper Plane Maps</h3>
          <h6 id="gray">English</h6>
          <p>Do you remember fourth grade? Do you remember recess and shy crushes? What about night mares, and what about dreams? I aspired to be something that I'm not, and no longer want to be. I dreamt that I'd be a town planner. I had nightmares that I'd move. I also had nightmares about kayaking, but that wasn't bad either. This is the story of how one intimidating change led to a series of events that a younger version of myself would've never expected. This certainly isn't fourth grade anymore. <br>
	I'm four feet ten inches, in fourth grade, at age ten. We received an assignment where we had to draw a map. If I was asked the purpose, I can safely say I don't recall. This is what I remember. I drew a zoo. It had shaky lines and inconsistencies. It also had heart and character. It was naive, unknown to what future events would occur. <br> How could it? <br> How could I? <br>
	I'm six feet one inch, in eleventh grade, at age seventeen. I received an assignment where I was to write a personal narrative of sorts to be analyzed by a student in the class. The purpose here is rather obvious. Yet, I did something that I got the idea for at three pm and now I'm writing this at three am. Now I'm looking back at my younger self, thinking, why was this a nightmare and not a dream. <br>
	I'm just under six feet, three days prior to moving, and about a week before school, on my fifteenth birthday. "Maybe it's the anxiety." I've spent under two weeks, total, of my life in the city I'm about to move to. I'm going into high school, that's scary enough. Also, my parents got divorced a year ago. Okay, ducks in the row, or; ducks in a shaky line crossing a river I drew in fourth grade. That's how I'd describe my emotions. Granted some ducks were happy, running across the shaky lines, jumping in paper rives. However some ducks were scared, hiding in the forest at the base of a mountain. <br>
	I'm still under six feet, just moved to Philadelphia, and a few days prior to school, at fifteen years of age plus three days. "It's definitely the anxiety." The crumpled and torn pages of my recent past fly by me like paper planes in the fourth grade classroom. Planes made of maps. Maps I forgot. Forgotten like memories of the all the good times I had in fourth grade. Little did I know I'd move, little did I know I'd find those maps. <br>
	I'm some age at some height at some time, and I'm depressed. Maps can't help me now. I miss my old life. I miss empty suburban streets. I miss the ice cream farm. I miss one family in one house. I miss being naive in fourth grade.<br>
	I'm a little older, sixteen maybe, six feet maybe, but I'm happy. I went from drawing cities to living in one. I made new friends, new hobbies, new dreams. I used to visit museums and now I work in one. I was anxious about high school, but I run to it. I drew a zoo in the fourth grade, and I volunteered in one.<br>
	I'm seventeen, in junior year, writing a paper on paper plane maps. I had an entire story already written. I chose to rewrite it all, completely, similar to how the move rewrote my future.<br>
This move, this one giant change, changed my entire life. Little did I know that paper plane maps could fly me across state lines to new dreams and old memories. When you unfold the paper planes, the pieces all finally connect. This is what fourth grade means to me. What's fourth grade mean to you?</p>

          <h3 id="mine">Mouthwash</h3>
          <h6 id="gray">Spoken Word Poetry Event</h6>
          <p>She's the kind of girl, <br>
That you've known for a month, <br>
But it's felt like a year,<br>
And hours go by like seconds,<br>
As you lose track of days. <br>
The type of girl that doesn't need good morning texts,<br>
Because she gets six every day.<br>
This girl,<br>
She Looks like she spent hours at a spa,<br>
Because her looks make heads turn.<br>
But in reality she just woke up.<br>
She just saw her six good morning texts.<br>
And your aren't one of the responses.<br>
And this is the girl,<br>
That you dreamt of a perfect kiss,<br>
And you miss it, <br>
But how can you miss a kiss,<br>
that still hasn't happened?<br>
Suddenly the month you've known her turns to two,<br>
And you stop keeping track of seconds,<br>
Like an AA former-addict keeps track of days sober.<br>
You grab your pocket watch,<br>
Watching the hands spin around,<br>
Until your arms are around each other.<br>
Like the gears of the watch got stuck,<br>
And time froze on this perfect moment.<br>
You finally get your kiss,<br>
But it leaves a sour taste in your mouth.<br>
Like running around barefoot,<br>
Then sticking your foot in your mouth.<br>
Or chewing on broken glass,<br>
Like ice cubes in summer.<br>
Or Biting tobacco between your teeth,<br>
Trying to be like a Major League Baseball player.<br>
Suddenly you can't talk,<br>
And it taste like sweat under toenails.<br>
It taste like blood covered glass crystals.<br>
It tastes like a 1960's pitchers mouth.<br>
And you never thought you'd know these taste,<br>
Until it's already happened.<br>
You try to get rid of the bad taste,<br>
You eat tic tacs like suicide risks pop pills.<br>
You take shots of mouthwash like an alcoholic.<br>
You use a full can of breathe spray,<br>
Like its your sixth grade dance,<br>
And the girl you want to grind on,<br>
Is standing across the room.<br>
You eat a bar of soap like you just said fuck,<br>
And your mom said she'll clean your mouth out.<br>
She makes you go to church even though you aren't religious,<br>
To eat the dull communion bread.<br>
You talk to your ex girlfriend,<br>
Because you know she'll put words in your mouth.<br>
And when that doesn't work,<br>
You chew on the last issue of the New Yorker,<br>
But the news only puts ideas in your head.<br>
So all you do is lay in bed,<br>
And your mom thinks your sick.<br>
You take a swig of medicine,<br>
Like a 1940's statesman drinks whiskey.<br>
You try everything, until you think about trying bleach.<br>
Suddenly it hits you,<br>
Like you fell flat on your face,<br>
And you bit a brick.<br>
You crack your teeth,<br>
And you realize, it's gone too far.<br>
You let the taste of her in your mouth,<br>
Drag you down and get stuck.<br>
Like hands on a broken watch.<br>
You eat Icebreakers for dinner,<br>
And drink Listerine to wash it down.<br>
You lay in bed staring at the ceiling.<br>
You have mouthwash on nightstand, <br>
In a water bottle,<br>
Like how junkies put vodka in orange juice.<br>
You set your alarm for your dentist appointment,<br>
Because you thought professional help was good.<br>
The dentist checks your teeth,<br>
The same ones you smashed with a brick,<br>
Unfortunately, he has nothing to prescribe for taste.<br>
You try Altoids and Chiclets,<br>
You chew double bubble,<br>
Just like when you were little,<br>
And you remember what it was like,<br>
Before you knew what a kiss taste like.<br>
And you dreamed mouthwash would take you back,<br>
But Colgate doesn't have that capability.<br>
Your shove your toothbrush so far down your throat,<br>
you feel like a porn star.<br>
And then the taste is worse,<br>
And you wish you had your mouthwash again.<br>
And the taste can't be cleaned.<br>
And now you wish you never liked her at all.<br>
Because you're scared you'll have her taste in your mouth again.<br>
She's the kind of girl,<br>
That is the inspiration for mouthwash.</p>

          <h3 id="mine">Sparrows</h3>
          <h6 id="gray">Personal Entertainment</h6>
          <p>The sun rose over the hill in the distance. A light haze still laid in the morning rays. A few trees dotted the perimeter of the pasture. A picket fence protested against their entry into the wide prestige pasture. A taxi yellow sun peeked over the hilltop, in the blue Caribbean Sea colored sky. Dew relaxed on the grass, as little worms snaked evasively to avoid the sparrow family. Against the tree in which Mr. And Mrs. Sparrow made their nest, were two bikes. A trail of  crumpled grass led to the spot where the two teenagers are. <br>
"That one looks like a rabbit," she said pointing and laughing.<br>
"No, no. That's not a rabbit. It has it has no ears," he responded jokingly.<br>
Taking it upon herself, she started a debate. "The ears are right there. Big puffy white years," she sat up trying to point.<br>
"Well, I don't see it."<br>
"Shut up! It's right there."<br>
"Maybe it's because I'm lost in your eyes."<br>
She drew back from the debate, blushing.<br>
"Oh now I see it."<br>
"See what?"<br>
"The rabbit silly."<br>
"Told you."<br>
They both laid back down, as the sun covered them in light. The sparrows went back to their nest, looking upon the two in the pasture. The day went on and they both had to go home.<br>
Later they returned to watch the sun set. The sparrows now settled in, waiting for the night to come. The bikes resumed their inanimate position against the tree. The fence still withheld the trees as they cast shadows upon the pasture. The moon now caressed the same hill that the sun climbed up in the morning. The sun fell gently across the sky, relaxing against the pill owing tree tops. The rabbit hopped out of the sky. Even though the evening was getting colder, the two kids looked up at the sky. Time lagged behind as it was now after seven o'clock on a Thursday. Both of them had to be home soon.<br>
The boy rolled onto his side to face the girl. She looks over at him. Now with the sunset in the background, the laid motionless, with each other. The girl,mumbled something, so naturally the boy leaned in. Maybe it was sunset, the cold air pulling them in, the sparrows cheering for them to kiss, or perhaps a combination of them all and more. As the sun set and their lips touched, it created an unforgettable moment for the both of them. The sparrows took one last flight into the night, as the couple rode home. Tweeting above them as the they pedaled, the moon lighting the path, the crisp air behind them, they smiled the entire ride home.<br>

          <h3 id="mine">Bully Project</h3>
          <h6 id="gray">Health</h6>
          <p>It was a Tuesday, when it started.
	The class groaned as the teacher announced a group project. The cute, popular clique shot side eyed looks at each other and stayed seated next to each other to start. The nerds moved from their dark corners and gathered around. They didn't really associate to well outside of projects, but they worked well when they had to. Then there was us, the center. Of course my girlfriend, Natalie, was sitting next to me. <br>
	"Groups must be three to four," he called out. <br>
	Blake, our mutual friend joined us. She sat across the table so she couldn't see me put my hand on Natalie's leg as we started. She was practically asking for it in those leggings though. She kept saying how I shouldn't do anything like that in class, but she always said it smirking. After all, I know what she's like outside of the classroom. <br>
	Everything was pretty normal. The popular girls kept looking at the nerds so they'd help. Of course they fell for it. Despite being the smartest in the school, they seemed pretty clueless when it comes to girls, even though one of them was a girl. We started work, half procrastinating and half talking about how we should work. Of course we barely got anything done. Blake and I kept telling jokes. Natalie didn't smile once. Soon enough the class was over, and luckily it was last period. Blake drove Natalie home and I started walking. I accidentally ran into some girl reading. Other than that, it was pretty uneventful. <br>
	It was Tuesday night when she went crazy. <br>
	We, Natalie and I, texted a little. She seemed kind of upset. I texted Blake. Apparently they talked in the car and Natalie didn't like my hand on her leg during class. I texted Natalie back and asked if that was right. She responded and said she liked it. It almost sounded like she was just reign to hide something.<br>
	I opened up snapchat and saw her message. She was still wearing those leggings, just the leggings. I guess she really liked class. After all, it's not the first time this happened. We'd surprise each other with stuff like this sometimes. We took turns exchanging pictures and comments. She was so hot, better than anyone before. I talked her out of those leggings and she had the nicest- I shouldn't go that far.  I screenshot it, and she seemed a bit upset. I told her I wouldn't show anyone. I guess she didn't believe me because she dumped me over text. I can't believe she had the nerve to do that. <br>
	I tired talking to Blake about it. She didn't really seem to side with either of us. She was trying to stay impartial. I could understand why. She was both our friends. She did agree that dumping me over text was rude. We talked for a little, but that was mostly it.<br>
	It was Wednesday morning when she refused.<br>
	I saw her in the hallway. She looked like she was trying to avoid me, but I caught up to her. I caught her by her arm, and turned her around by the lockers. She glared at me, and it was so attractive. I asked her to get back together and she just went crazy. She kept yelling at me and cursing. <br>
	"I'll give you one last chance to get back with me," I told her.<br>
	"Why the hell would I want to get back with you?" She asked smugly.<br>
	"Because," I paused, "I have this." I quickly showed her my phone. She blushed and looked mad. The bell rang and she ran to class. It almost looked like she went into the girls bathroom, but I've never seen her cry. She was probably fine. I saw Blake walk out of the bathroom later and she wouldn't talk to me. I don't know what I did to her.   <br>
	Last period again. It was awkward and silent. None of us talked. You could hear the nerds working out calculations. You could here the cute girls in the corner working the nerds. Eventually the whole room was pretty quiet. All anyone heard was the pages of a book turning, or an occasional scribbling of a pen. It's like someone was taking notes on life. After a while, I almost felt like the star of a bad reality tv show. <br>
	"E! Network presents High School," I whispered. No one thought it was funny. Not until someone else muttered, "Did you mean Degrassi?" The class all laughed, and the teacher hushed us. <br>
	We walked out. Natalie was the fastest. I followed her, not even with time to put my phone in my pocket, and Blake after me. I tried to catch up. At least before she stopped and pivoted to face me. <br>
	"What do you want with we?" She screamed.
	I tried to clam her down. "Baby, you're what I want. I want us to be us."<br>
	She slapped my phone out of my hand, yelling at first, "Then why-" She fell to a whisper, "Why do you have that." <br>
	"What?"<br>
	"You know 'what,' Tyler."<br>
	My phone was still on. It's only after all of this that someone marched out of last period and picked up my phone. She deleted the picture, took her book, and left. Natalie walked away after that. I stood dumbfounded. Blake just watched the whole thing. I realized that was the same girl I ran into the other day. I didn't even know she was in our class. I watched her walk away. She looked good when she walked away to. <br>
	I wasn't getting back together with Natalie. I decided to walk after the stranger.</p>

          <h3 id="mine">Tree</h3>
          <h6 id="gray">Personal Entertainment</h6>
          <p>A dying tree in the forest, <br>
Alone, it stands.<br>
Bending towards the light,<br>
Barely able to survive.<br>
Winter is coming,<br>
The tree withers,<br>
As it had for months on end.<br>
No one stops to help,<br>
But they admire the rest.<br>
Leaves sprouting,<br>
Branches touching the sky,<br>
Of all the trees around it.<br>
This tree is decayed,<br>
With weeds surrounding it's base.<br>
A crow builds it's nest atop.<br>
While birds chirp,<br>
The crow screeches.<br>
The winter is cold, lonely, quiet,<br>
As is the tree.<br>
This tree takes in few nutrients,<br>
And little sunlight.<br>
Vines choke it neck.<br>
Branches at its side,<br>
Doing nothing,<br>
But scraping the bark.<br>
Because how could anyone love a dying tree,<br>
In the heart of the forest, not the heart of others.<br>
<br>
The tree dies.<br>
Loggers take the tree down.<br>
Burned, cut, destroyed.<br>
Most of all, it will never be fixed.<br>
The crow stays on the stump.<br>
A baby bird is born,<br>
The stump is its home.<br>
Spring rolls around,<br>
A single flower grows.<br>
Using what's left of the tree,<br>
The flower grows.<br>
However beautiful,<br>
It's dangerous.<br>
This flowers kills.<br>
The baby crow,<br>
Now struggling.<br>
Momma crow,<br>
Dead.<br>
Baby crow,<br>
Dying.<br>
The flower,<br>
Is the only surviver.<br>
Poisonous,<br>
Feared,<br>
Alone,<br>
As was the tree.<br>
<br>
Wood from the tree,<br>
Is sent away.<br>
Carved, shaped, molded.<br>
The wood,<br>
A new purpose for the tree.<br>
The wood,<br>
New handles for tools.<br>
Hatchets, axes, knives.<br>
A bad ending,<br>
To a worse beginning.<br>
The weapons are shipped.<br>
Sap drips,<br>
From the rugged arms,<br>
Of fellow forest members.<br>
The tree, dead,<br>
Is now causing harm.<br>
Once a great forest,<br>
Gone.<br>
Trees dying,<br>
Forest falling,<br>
Crows screeching.<br>
Sustainability never again,<br>
All starting with one tree.<br>
Death of one,<br>
Causing slaughter of many.<br>
Because the tree,<br>
Is the root of many.</p>
